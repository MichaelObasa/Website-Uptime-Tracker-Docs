# Website-Uptime-Tracker-Docs

The Website Uptime Tracker is a Python script I created that allows me to monitor the uptime and availability of multiple websites. It periodically sends HTTP requests to the chosen websites and records the response status codes and response times. I chose this tool because it's useful for website owners, system administrators, and developers who want to ensure that their websites are accessible and functioning properly, which I believe is also skill that will assist me on my journey as a DevOps Engineer.
